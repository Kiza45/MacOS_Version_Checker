# MacOS_Version_Checker

Simple bash script that prints the latest version of MacOS avaialble. Useful for Windows users who support Mac Environments/users and need to make sure MacBooks are on the lastest OS before being deployed.

Advisable to create a batch file and use Task Scheduler on Windows to trigger the script at log on of any user, to check at the start of the day.
